"Dell 7440, Amazing Brilliance","Dell 7440: Unleashing Productivity with Style

From the first day I laid hands on the Dell 7440, I knew it was a winner. Lightweight, wickedly fast, and remarkably quiet, this machine has become my daily companion, seamlessly blending work and leisure.

Performance Prowess

I've put the Dell 7440 through its paces with various day-to-day tasks, both from a business standpoint and for personal enjoyment. Running multiple programs to increase the CPU load became a sort of personal challenge, and guess what? This laptop emerged victorious every single time. No matter what I threw at it, it never skipped a beat.

Audio Bliss at My Fingertips

The strategically placed audio speakers at the edge of the keyboard are a genius touch. They don't just produce sound; they create an immersive audio experience that adds a certain richness to my virtual meetings and elevates my music and video streaming sessions.

Visual Delight

The screen is a feast for the eyesâ€”bright, vibrant, and clear. Whether I'm crunching numbers for work or catching up on the latest shows, the display quality is consistently impressive. It's the kind of visual experience that turns mundane tasks into enjoyable moments.

Under the Hood Brilliance

Let's talk specs. The Dell 7440 boasts an Intel 13th Gen With vPro i7-1365U processor, 16GB of RAM, and a spacious 512GB HD. Connectivity is a breeze with 1x HDMI, 2x USB-C ports, and 2x USB ports. The larger trackpad? It's a small detail that makes a big difference, especially when you're navigating through hectic workdays.

Pitching the Upgrade

I'm not just singing the praises of this laptop for my benefit. I'm genuinely considering pushing for an upgrade across the executive board. The Dell 7440 brings not just functionality but a touch of sophistication that aligns perfectly with our professional environment. It's the kind of upgrade that can enhance not just individual productivity but the overall work experience.

Final Verdict: A Must-Have for Professionals

In conclusion, the Dell 7440 is more than just a laptop; it's a productivity powerhouse that fits seamlessly into both work and personal life. I wholeheartedly recommend this machine to anyone looking for a perfect blend of style and performance. Time to set a new standard, starting with my own workspace.",5
All as promised and good so far,"The delivery communication, timing, packaging, and completeness was great and exactly as promised. The LT was ready to go with Win 11 as soon as I pulled it out.

So far performance is good, the i7 processor definitely has the machine running smoothly, time will tell after it gets a pile of Windows updates though!
It has an adequate amount of ports compared to other new devices, 2 thunderbolt (one for charging), HDMI and 2 USB.
Overall, I like the design and use of the latitude so far, it's also very quiet in normal use (haven't really tested it with any resource hungry applications just yet), so hoping it will continue to run like this and give me a few years of enjoyable use!",5
Great thin and light powerhouse for discerning business users,"14"" is the new 13"" -- get these laptops with the ultralight configuration including the 5MP webcam and your users will love you (caveat there is not fingerprint reader on the ultralight).

The speed of bootup with the solid state drive is fantastic. The keyboard feedback is excellent. My only complaint is simply the large size of the mouse pad. I am not used to it yet and keep touching it at the wrong times as I type. But that should fade as I get used to it. Great laptop.",5

Excellent laptop with exceptional battery life,"This laptop came with a 10 core processor (2 Power cores, 8 Efficiency cores), 32 GB of RAM, and a 500 GB NVMe drive. The 14"" screen (non-touch) is easy to read, bright, and a comfortable size. I set the scale to 150% to accommodate my old eyes. The keyboard and touch pad work and feel great. I set up the system to log me in with both facial recognition and with a fingerprint. Facial recognition works surprisingly well in low light. The only time it didn't work was outside, with the Sun shining on the camera. Speaking of the camera, the video, audio, and microphone worked well in remote meetings.

It has a useful set of ports: Two USB-C, two USB-A, one HDMI, and one old-style headphone jack. Both USB-C ports are capable of powering this computer.

I connected three 27"" monitors to this laptop at the same time, and it handled them nicely. Two were connected to a docking station on one of the laptop's USB-C port, and the third monitor was connected directly to the other port.

I tested gaming on it. The video adapter is purely Intel. I tried playing No Man's Sky on it. It was playable, but not a great experience. I wouldn't recommend this laptop for gaming, though it wasn't designed or marketed for that, so that's fair.

I made a drive image backup, then installed both Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04 on it. Both systems worked very well on this laptop, with the exception of the built in web cam, which seems to lack Linux drivers at this time. I did a drive speed test, which resulted in around 3800 MB/sec read speed. Wow! That's the fastest NVMe drive I have ever used, so I was thoroughly impressed.

The battery life on this machine is very impressive. It is hard to give a single answer on how many hours to expect, as it depends on what load it is under. It varies between 7 hours and 20 hours, depending on what I'm doing. I'm confident it would make it through an entire work day under normal use, so I give it high marks for battery life.

I would definitely recommend this computer for anything except gaming, and will definitely consider it for future business purchases.",5
Great workhorse,Fantastic responsive and light,5
Great system and nice hardware,Over all the laptop is very powerful and great hardware in a small sleek profile. I do still have issue with the trackpad but that is more a windows issue than dell. Glad to see previous conserns have been addresses in this model.,5

Dell 7440: a laptop for lawyers,"A super quick piece of kit with capacity to add 3 big Dell monitors using my power dock. Iâ€™m a lawyer and I work from the office, the courts and from home.

Great Laptop,"The 7440 XCTO is light weight, fast and the screen looks great.  I love the light up keyboard and fingerprint reader.  The sound is excellent, the trackpad is large and responsive and if you accidently rest your hand on it, it doesn't go crazy.  It doesn't get crazy hot when charging or when using it so it is comfortable to use on your lap.  It flips over to tablet mode without having to disconnect the keyboard which is convenient so you don't have to worry about misplacing the keyboard and you still have access to all the ports.  There is a strong magnet on the side to hold the pen.  Other laptops that I have used that had this feature had weak magnets that made losing the pen a real possibility.  The styling is generic Dell which is actually ok as it makes it less flashy and less prone to theft.  Overall a great laptop at a good price.  10 out of 10, would buy again.",5
"Well designed, powerful compact laptop",This laptop is terrific.  Dell really has stepped it up and continues to impress.  The thin form factor is so incredibly lightweight.  Don't be deceived by it's small size as it packs a punch.  The processor is super fast and it is very snappy.  It has all of the ports that I need for business and the battery lasts and lasts.  The screen clarity and camera quality make working a breeze.  The keys are comfortable and feel nice as you type.  The touchpad is large and useful.  I love the power button towards the top right.  The color is a beautiful deep blue which looks sharp.,5
College Student Review,"This laptop is very nice, its the perfect weight and dimensions, making it a great laptop to carry around. The keyboard is very nice and the keys are smooth to type on.

Great performances,TÂ»his one really delivers. Pleanty RAM and Processor speed.,5
"Lightweight, compact, yet powerful","I have never been a fan of Dell products in the past, as I always imagined them to be too bulky and heavy for my tastes (and my back!) but I was quite pleased by this laptop.  Being used to the triangle of laptop quality (power /style /weight), I was surprised to find that it actually solves for all three.  Well played, Dell - Iâ€™ll have to keep you in consideration when I update my gaming rig, in case youâ€™ve improved that area as well.",5

Great laptop!,"The 7440 has a great feel, love the aluminum casing.  Super fast with the 13th gen processor.",5
Flagship done right!,"This is the most well executed laptop model that Dell has released in a while. They clearly took the best features from the precision line, and what people wanted from previous Latitude models and put it together to create an amazing device that's capable and lightweight at the same time. The 7440 has everything my company needs for an executive end user, it's got 5G, 13th gen Intel, 32GB of ram, a QHD Matte display, a decent webcam, and powerful speakers, in a very light and small form factor. If I had to pick a windows laptop that closely compares to a m1 MacBook pro, this would be it.",5
Awesome Laptop,Easy to issue and full charging will gives long time durability,5

Great Laptop!!,"Light Weight, Fast and great battery life!",5
Highly recommend!,It is very sleek and nice to work with. The touch screen isn't a bother and is great once I need it. The battery life is very long and the keyboard has an amazing sound as well.,5
Best laptop of 5 previous laptop computers I have owned!,"This laptop is the perfect combination of power, I7 with 16GB memory, keyboard key size and feel plus it is touch screen. It is equipped with a fingerprint reader and I know this saves me at least 20 minutes every day and I don't have to remember the passkey. I power two 28"" external monitors and I am using the Dell Thunderbolt Dock which also charges the Latitude 7440's batteries all thru one thunderbolt connection. The laptop ran about 8 hours of heavy use on its internal batteries alone. It is processing Camtasia video renderings about 20% faster that my other 5 year old Dell laptop G7 which is also an I7 with 16GB of memory. Not one issue with the 7440 or the docking station. Love this machine.",5
Great travel workstation,"My wife needed a new work system and this is the one she went with. It works great, its light and powerful. It acts as a personal workstation at home and easy to travel laptop while she is on the go",5
Dir IT,it works well with the large keyboard including a keypad for financial.,5
My favorite Latitude model to date,"I've been fortunate enough to try out all of the new '40' series laptops and this is by far my favorite.  It's not too large and not too small, as the 14"" screen is just right for performing daily tasks.  The best enhancement besides the latest processor in this series is the speakers as they now throw the sound up whereas in the past they'd throw it downwards, so hearing audio on this newer model is much better than in the past.  I'll probably be buying many of these within the near future.",5

My 13 Year Old Daughter's New 2in1 Laptop,"I am very happy with the service provided by Dell. Initially the wrong model was sent, however it was quickly and courteously exchanged for the correct one and the money I initially paid was promptly refunded as soon as the original (incorrect) model reached Dell's Sydney NSW office. 
We reside a long way away from Sydney in regional QLD thus the turnaround time was very impressive.
My daughter is of course, extremely happy with her new 2in1 technology and it's the first time either of us had ever seen or used Windows 11. It's very intuitive and easier to navigate than its Windows 10 predecessor.
The laptop itself has the latest Intel 13th Gen Core i7 processor and 16 GB memory and is extremely fast.",5

If I had to make one small nitpick, I would just mention the keyboard itself feels a bit lower quality than the rest of the outstanding ultralight hardware build.

Still an excellent system overall.",5

Latitude 7440 Review for business user,Love the feel and weight of the laptop but the processor seems a bit slower than I expected.,4
Nice laptop with good features,"I haven't used it for very long and it is replacing an older XPS13.  So far it performs well and the additional inch in the screen is nice.

Having the power button in the normal keyboard field is going to take some time to become accustomed to.  

I use the laptop connected to a docking station and would like to have USB-C ports on both sides of the laptop.  With them only on the left the dock cable has to run around to the far side and the Dell dock cables are short.  It's troublesome but less so than changing to have the laptop on the righthand side of the desktop monitors.

The speakers work pretty well.  I like the placement so stereo sound is effective.
The camera is pretty wide angled and has a good image.",4
"Its clunkier than my 7200 model, but otherwise good","Its clunkier than my 7200 model, but otherwise good",4
Great machine but requires much configuration,Excellent performance.  Initial setup was abysmal however.  BIOS was all screwed up and required siginficant configuration before the laptop would boot into auto setup mode for Windows.   The default mouse settings are FAR too sensitive.   In general the default configuration for settings are WAY too conservative and thus far too much time is spent getting the laptop into a real world usable configuration.,4
"Nice Blue, Nice Weight","New blue color looks nice, ultralight model offers noticeable weight reduction, but not by a lot",4
Sleek & Powerful,Product is sleek and great performance. very convenient for day to day work style.,4
Highly recommend,Laptop works great. We needed a solid laptop for the field that had 5g. This ticked every box. We also purchased the dock which works great as well.,4
So far so good.,So far we've had great results with this laptop.  It seems Dell has ironed out some of the ssd and driver issues with the past  couple of generations.,4
Bluetooth,The Bluetooth sometimes doesn't work or will connect to the device but not for the audio but other than that I love it!,4
Mouse and Power off button,"Speed and memory power excellent. But the mouse sensitivity is too fast, and the function to slow it down does not work. Also the off power button next to the delete button is ridiculous!",4

Latitude 7440 Laptop,fits client needs perfectly,4
Latitude 7440,"The weight and features of the device are pleasant and align with other modern specs for PCs.  The camera quality, while nice to include IR compatibility with Windows Hello, still feels like a ""laptop camera"" instead of a true ""webcam"".  Low light performance is still limited and it would be nice to see a 4K upgrade.  The weight of the laptop makes it extremely portable; however, the plastic materials make it also feel flimsy, as if carrying it loftily from a desk to a couch would risk breaking it if not fully supported with both hands or gripped by the spine instead of an edge.  The screen looks good and does not seem to contribute much to eye fatigue and the keyboard and trackpad seem appropriately responsive.  Boot up time is quick, as expected, and performing standard productivity workflows like web browsing, document editing, and video conferencing is smooth without noticable interference from the hardware.  The available security features for enterprise-level management seem broad, although I have not fully explored those yet.  Altogether this is a nice daily-driver that can fit a variety of standard workloads and workflows.",4
Great performance and design,Great performance and design,4
A decent device that is well built and powerful.,"The review is for the laptop version of the 7440 and not the 2-in-1.
It's a decent laptop, not the largest of screen sizes but what it lacks in size, it packs in power and functionality.
Backlit keyboard is nice and responsive, the IR webcam is quick and picks up facial recognition really well and is obviously Windows Hello ready.
The laptop also has fingerprint recognition capabilities but I haven't tested it.
The screen is good and looks like it has some sort of anti-reflective film which drastically reduces glare and really usable in sunny or bright light areas.
The speakers are fantastic, great sound and where they are positioned on either side, you do get the sense of some surround sound but don't expect it to be 5.1 or 7.1, these are still speakers built into a laptop with little depth, but you could easily do without headphones when listening to music or watching video content.
The weight is fine and it isn't the thinnest of laptops but that does mean you do get more than just 2 USB-C ports, you get HDMI & standard USB ports, which is great because you don't have to carry around a portable docking station for extra ports.
There is one thing that I don't like much but think it was built by design. When you open the lid and fold it back beyond the upright 90 degree's the bottom of the lid pushes down on the flat surface which gives a little lift to the keyboard, which is a nice touch for those that like some elevation of their keyboard. The downside to this is that the edge of the monitor scraps the surface as you are rotate the screen and therefore could damage the edge if the surface isn't flat and smooth or clean.
I also took the opportunity to play some games as well, just to see how well it faired without a dedicated GPU. Played Fornite and it was a little stuttery with the settings at near high quality, reduced it down to mid-level visual quality and it was very playable. Not advocating that this laptop is in anyway a gaming laptop because it isn't, I was purely demostrating the capabilities of this laptop.",4
Dell Latitude 7440 XCTO review,Computer received in good order and works fine after setting up.,4
Latitude 7440 - impressive,"impressive laptop, fairly thin, lightweight and very capable machine. This is a workhorse of a laptop which we intend to use for the majority of our business needs outside of engineering",4
Great Improvement from the older model...,"Sleek look and fast performance. The touch pad is great. It has a very good screen. On the whole, a very happy experience.",4
Excellent product,"Great product, works well but bit heavy to carry around",4
Dell Review,"Overall, I do really like the laptop and happy I went with a Dell vs Mac this time. I do wish they offered a touchscreen for the price I paid. Also, does have some lag to it when I am multitasking.",4
Good business laptop with familiarity of previous model,Nice lighter laptop no info of new features so not sure of what to look for with the upgrade outside the usual battery and speed.  Seems to be a smooth transition from one to the other and very familiar but modern.,4
Great Fit,Works exactly as expected.,4
Great laptop with a questionable touch pad,"These are great laptops, and they recently added a second USB-A connector which is a massive improvement (ONE was ridiculous). The only issue is for some reason the track pad buttons don't appear to work 100% of the time - more like 90-95%, which is sufficient to make you think they're good enough to use and just bad enough to be incredibly annoying. Reasonably light, reasonably small, and more than powerful enough for the vast majority of users. Use a Bluetooth mouse and the button issue becomes a nothing-burger.",4
Perfect in business category,"Good performance, little bit design is disappointed",4
"Speedy performance machine, could use a bigger screen and better speakers","This laptop is built very well and sturdy.  It is lightweight and easy to carry around.  The keys are relatively quiet.  The performance is speedy and there is no delay throughout the day. The camera is up to date and crystal clear.  Sound levels of the speakers could be higher, but still decent for a laptop.  Screen size is a bit on the tiny side, but does work well and look good.",4

dfbdfd,the PO process can be made easier,4
One of the best work computers made by Dell; more power efficient processors make the hardware even better,"Nice laptop, good weight and sturdiness. The keyboard and touchpad are some of the best Dell has made yet. I wish there was a more affordable option for a higher-resolution screen, but I'm sure that will come. Price is good for what you get and the battery life is pretty great. Most of our users can get 6-8 hours without charging from a new device. Obviously that will get shorter over time, but it's a good starting point. A lot of this is made possible by the newer 13-generation Intel processors, which are finally, FINALLY getting to a point where they're not causing heat issues and fans running constantly. If Intel continues to have their processors follow a less power-hungry model, this will only improve.",4
Latitude 7440,"I purchased a Dell Latitude 7440 about 2 weeks ago after looking at many laptops but decided to purchased online for simplicity and it was delivered within 3 days as stated. Easy to setup straight out of the box but it has taken me a little while to get use to the new windows layout. All in all its a great little PC, solid and fast, it does everything i want in a travel laptop. Good build quality, small enough to fit in a backpack but powerful enough to do workshop presentations, spreadsheets or stream a movie. I wasn't sure about not having a network connection built in or if i could plug in all my accessories but so far i've had no problems and once i got everything copied across i haven't looked back. My biggest problem is i now have to update all my other accessories to match the new PC. It is only early days but i'm feeling confident as it came with a 3 year warranty.",4
Good lightweight business-grade laptop let down by some of the included Dell business software.,"The laptop build is solid and thermal\heat management is pretty good also. The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 star rating is some of the software components that needs improvement, specifically the Dell Optimiser application that comes with the laptop. I tried using it for about 2 weeks and it's quite buggy with regards to auto-monitoring the quality video\audio conferencing calls and the ""on-looker"" detection functionality. It needs improvement and I have disabled that functionality for now.",4
"Lightweight, portable with all necessary ports. The USB C port needs to be receded into the bevel to keep it from moving and becoming wobbly. This is the main point of failure for these when using docking stations.","Lightweight and low heat generated, very impressive.

Great Business Machine!,"the larger trackpad takes some getting used to coming from the 7290, but this unit is fast and a great upgrade",4
Dell 7440 review,"Our company is considering switching over to Dell laptops from a different brand.  So far, we've been impressed with the build quality and overall features of the laptop.  So far, the 2 biggest ""complaints"" have been the separation, or lack of separation, of the backspace and Enter key and the wide angle view of the integrated camera.  Both are minor, and if these are the things that users are sharing for feedback, I'd say that this is a great machine.",4
Dell Latituded 7440 XCTO,Nice size. Great screen quality. Login proctections are good. Only downside is there is no privacy screen nor an easy way to print screen.,4
Ergonomic review,"USB-C port and HDMI port all on the left side of the laptop, not convenient",4
DELL vs MAC,This is a very nice beefy machine. It's very comparable to the MacBook.,4
Good Product but a step backwards in feel.,Functionality and speed are excellent.  The negative is that this device no longer has a premium feel without the carbon fiber and feels like the same plastic product you get with a 5440.,4
Latitude 7440 - Another Dell success story (thus far),"Nicely designed frame, sleek and solid, very contemporary. High-contrast screen makes interaction a breeze, even after hours of continual use. Solid touch-response from the keyboard. Processing power (thus far) is substantial, with good performance ratings across a number of benchmark apps. Typical complete suite of supportive tools and features that promise to provide reduced start-up time, increase battery life and help to prioritize functionality of oft-used apps. Security features are well designed for the typical office environment, with the ability to grey-out the screen if the system notices someone looking over your shoulder. 
Evaluation continues; no notable deficiencies found thus far. This appears to be another quality Dell product, thus far.",4
More durable,"Much better than the 5xxx series, the aluminum shell seems more durable, I have so many scratched laptops from the 53xx and 54xx series that i can't reuse them. I am hoping the case on the 7440 is longer lasting for our Green-IT initiative.",4
No surprises in a good way,Does everything we needed it to.,4
Laptop Review,"Super laptop, fast.  Bit of trouble with camera causing windows crash but the newest bios and camera software fixed the problem.",4
Fast and lightweight,"Fast, lightweight, runs cool.",4
Great Machine,The battery life on this device is awesome. I don't have to worry about plugging it in every couple of hours. Using the 2-1 with the Dell Pen is great for taking notes. My only negative is it is a little heavy to carry around and work on for more than 30ish minutes.,4
"High performing, light-weight system","The Dell Latitude 7440 is tremendously responsive, delivering great performance in a light-weight package.",4
Very Nice,Very nice. Only negative was all the crap ware that comes pre installed. Dell always needs an option to get a clean machine. At least it didnt have Norton!,4
Great Laptop!,"Great laptop that I use to work from home. Screen size is perfect and love the flexibility to move around the house without dropping wifi.  The only minor issue is for about a month, it would blue screen every so often (once every couple of weeks) but that seems to be resolved after applying updates.  I get a lot of use out of this laptop and would recommend it.",4
"Fast, light and quick laptop","If fast, light and feels durable. I like the older models case better though.",4
Not as good as last Dell purchase,"Less than happy with with the individual that i bought this through, now having frustartions with tech support",3

Potential Exec laptop replacement,"This laptop is *light*, very very light. Which is great from a portability standpoint. We have not have quite long enough to fully judge it's use case regarding the battery life or the software loaded from our company. But I can say that this would likely be a wonderful laptop for support personnel that often travel. I would caution against handing this to any executives that are looking for a ""polished"" machine in regard to the body type. The screen has a bit of flex when closed; not enough to be any concern, but noteworthy.",3
Portable vs Traditional,Device is slim and portable.  East to setup.  Speaker and microphone quality was good for a single user but not good use in a meeting setting.  Rear camera worked well but front facing camera wasn't didn't work.,3
not an improvement over the same version from 4 years ago,"no improvement from the 2019 version of the 7400, hate the mousepad and buttons being integrated into a single pad and not separate buttons, the larger mousepad makes it difficult to type on the keyboard, and an older/slower CPU is actually a downgrade",3
The laptop is great but ordering process went wrong.,The purchasing process was very incovenient this time since Dell had to cancel my original PO after few days for some internal issue. Then I had to reorder the laptop again. It created extra work for me and IT team as well as delayed my order.,3

Unleashing Productivity On-the-Go with the Latitude 7440,"The Latitude 7440 has proven to be an invaluable tool for my daily work. Its compact size, combined with its lightweight design, makes it incredibly convenient to carry around, be it in meetings within the office or for on-the-go tasks outside. I've been particularly impressed with its battery life, which consistently sees me through an entire workday without the need for a recharge. This has been a game-changer for me, allowing uninterrupted work sessions both in and out of the office. For those in search of a reliable and portable work companion, the Latitude 7440 is a commendable choice.",3

EVO certification is important to me because it indicates a better performing laptop and overall computing experience.  I am disappointed that I found out that this laptop is not EVO certified and I will be returning it for another one.  I have been using Dell products for over a decade and I have been very satisfied with Dell and I would recommend Dell to my friends and family.  However, in my particular situation, I was told that I would get a 15% restocking fee if I return the laptop. I have been working with management and I hope this is not the case.  The laptop is good and the 36GB makes easy work of my statistical software.  If it were EVO certified, like my previous Latitude 7420 model, this would be the perfect business/travel laptop.",2

"Great Laptops, but Quality Control has slipped","Ordered 2 laptops, 1 was DOA upon delivery.  Unfortunately this was not unique - last order was for 9 laptops, 2 were DOA.  Something has seriously gone wrong with Quality Control in the factory.
