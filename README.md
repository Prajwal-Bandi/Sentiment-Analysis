# üìù Amazon Product Reviews Sentiment Analysis

This project is a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** based system designed to classify user sentiments into **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral** categories using Amazon product review data. The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from user-generated content to improve customer satisfaction and business decisions.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The sentiment analysis model was trained on product reviews collected from Amazon. It analyzes review text and classifies it into one of three sentiment categories:
- ‚úÖ **Positive**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Neutral**
- ‚ùå **Negative**

This project demonstrates how machine learning and NLP can be used to automate opinion mining and support better product analysis and recommendation systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Tokenization** ‚Äì Breaking text into sentences and words
- **Stopword Removal** ‚Äì Removing common words with low information
- **Stemming** ‚Äì Reducing words to their root form
- **Vectorization** ‚Äì Using **TF-IDF** to convert text into numerical form
- **Sentiment Polarity Analysis** ‚Äì Using **TextBlob** to compute polarity scores for classification

### 2. Model Building & Evaluation
- Applied multiple ML algorithms:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Naive Bayes Classifier
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- Implemented **ensemble modeling** to boost accuracy
- Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

### 3. Deployment
- Built an interactive **Streamlit web application**
- Allows users to input custom text
- Displays real-time sentiment classification and polarity score
